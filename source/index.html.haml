.about

    about me
  %p.then
    My full name is Alexander Flatscher and I live in Austria. I started (web)programming at the age of 16 with JavaScript (and   HTML table layouts... how foolish...). Now I've made my Bachelor of Science in Multi Media Technology with focus on web and communities at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg.
  %p.now
    Right now I mainly focus on developing websites and webapps with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript (with a CoffeScript flavor), although I know some other languages too, e.g. PHP, Java (Android), C++.
  %p.like
    In the web I like to animate objects and move things around. I like fancy and colorful designs and websites with clear edges.
